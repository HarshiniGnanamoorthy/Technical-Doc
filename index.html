                        <p>Java is a High Level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

                        <p>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages</p>

                        <li>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:<br>
                              1.It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.<br>                             2. It must be robust and secure.<br>
                              3.It must be architecture-neutral and portable.<br>
                              4.It must execute with high performance.<br>
                              5.It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.<br>
                        </li>
                        <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>

                        Java
                        code:

                       Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
                       Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
                      Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

                      . Comments are ignored by the compiler while compiling a code.The Java comments are the statements that are not executed by the compiler and interpreter. The comments can be used to provide information or explanation about the variable, method, class or any statement. It can also be used to hide program code.

                        A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.Variable is name of reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" that means its value can be changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       A variable is the basic unit of storage in a program.The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

                           Java is an object-oriented programming language.A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.A class describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.A class is a group of objects which have common properties.<br>
                           A class in Java can contain:<br>
                            1.Fields<br>
                            2.Methods<br>
                            3.Constructor<br>
                            4.Blocks<br>
                            5.Nested class and interface<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:<br> 
                            1.Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access.<br>
                            2.class keyword: class keyword is used to create a class.<br>
                            3.Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).<br>
                            4.Superclass(if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.<br>
                            5.Interfaces: A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.<br>
                            6.Body: The class body surrounded by braces, { }.iant.<br>

                    <article>
                        <p>Data types are divided into two groups:
                         1.Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
                         2.Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Primitive data types</li>
                                <li>byte- Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127.</li>
                                <li>short- Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 </li>
                                <li>int - Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</li>
                                <li>long- Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807</li>
                                <li>float- Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits</li>
                                <li>double- Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
                                </li>
                                <li>boolean- Stores true or false values
                                </li>
                                <li>char-Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
                                </li>

                        <li>Non-primitive data types</li>
                        Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
                         The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:<br>
                          1.Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).<br>
                          2.Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.<br>
                          3.A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.<br>
                          4.A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.<br>
                          5.The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.<br>

                        Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
                        Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false An if statement looks as follows:

                        <code>if (condition) {
                            statement_1;
                            } else {
                            statement_2;
                            }</code>
                       
                        <p>
                            Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
                            Condition is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <code>if (condition_1) {
                            statement_1;
                            } else if (condition_2) {
                            statement_2;
                            } else if (condition_n) {
                            statement_n;
                            } else {
                            statement_last;
                            } </code>
                        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will
                        be
                        executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                        general,
                        it's
                        good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

                        <code>if (condition) {
                            statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                            } else {
                            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                            }</code>
                        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the
                        assignment can be
                        confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                        <code>if (x = y) {
                            /* statements here */
                            }</code>
                        If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                        additional
                        parentheses around the assignment. For example:

                        <code>if ((x = y)) {
                            /* statements here */
                            }</code>

                        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A
                        while
                        statement looks as follows:

                        <code>while (condition)
                            statement</code>
                        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
                        the
                        statement following the loop.

                        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns
                            true,
                            statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
                            execution
                            stops
                            and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>

                        When we know exactly how many times we want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:

                        <code>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
                             // code block to be executed
                           }</code>
                        Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.<br>     Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.<br>                      Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.<br>

                        The switch statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

                        <code>switch(expression) {
                                            case x:
                                             // code block
                                                break;
                                            case y:
                                            // code block
                                                break;
                                              default:
                                           // code block
                                                  }</code>
                        The switch expression is evaluated once.he value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

                        The break statement is used to jump out of a loop.It breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition. In case of inner loop, it breaks only inner loop.When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

                        <code>jump-statement;    
                            break; </code>

                        The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.The continue statement is used in loop control structure when you need to jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. It can be used with for loop or while loop.p. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified condition. In case of an inner loop, it continues the inner loop only.Java continue statement is used in all types of loops such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop.

                       <code>jump-statement;    
                            continue; </code>
